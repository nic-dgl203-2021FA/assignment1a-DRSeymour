          <h2>Communications Design Student</h2>

          <p>I am seeking employment in my new career as a Graphics & Website Designer. With a few more months of 
            NIC education, I will be well on my way to showcasing my work!</p>
          <p>This is a career transition from Certified Dental Assisting of 35 years to finally express my creative
            side. I've always enjoyed dabbling in computer graphics and platform websites but now I will have more
            functionality of design. Twenty more years to put a mark in this world!

            <h3>Social Good Poster</h3>
            <p>This is a student project to learn skills in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
            <p>This project was to research a graphic designer who inspired your and in their style, create a Poster
              to bring awareness to a social issue. The graphic designer I chose to imitate is Kate Moross because of her
              passion for candy wrapper packaging as a child. I too was inspired by the cartoonistic styling of many
              sweet treats!
            </p>
            <p>My social awareness issue is to 'Save the Bees'. It is a world wide issue in that it reflects our food 
              production everywhere as these pollinators travel far and wide. Modern pesticides and habitat destruction has 
              resulted in an alarming reduction of these important little critters. We need to change the destructive habits 
             and to accomplish this, media is necessary for awareness.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>Times are changing and our 35+ years of formal applications and processes 
            for self governance have been declined by the BC government. We are the only front-line health care providers 
            without our own health umbrella and automony. My education and experience is no longer a benefit as the BC College of 
            Dental Surgeons has decided that employees can be trained chairside. This completely devalues our certification 
            and opens incredible risk to the public. 
          </p>
          <p>Ask your next dental assistant if they're certified!</p>
