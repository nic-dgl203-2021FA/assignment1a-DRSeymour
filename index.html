          <h2>Communications Design Student</h2>

          <p>I am seeking employment in my new career as a Graphics & Website Designer. With a few more months of 
            NIC education, I will be well on my way to showcasing my work!</p>
          <p>This is a career transition from Certified Dental Assisting of 35 years to finally express my creative
            side. I've always enjoyed dabbling in computer graphics and platform websites but now I will have more
            functionality of design. Twenty more years to put a mark in this world!

            <h3>Assignment 1 with Christina Troung LinkedIn</h3>
            <p>This is a student project to review CSS coding. It is definately required.</p>
            <p>I know this will help me greatly as I was lost near the end of Introduction to CSS. Practice, 
              practice, practice! Besides, Panda bears are soooo cute! I wanted to continued talking about these cute little Bears so that I could 
              get the text to wrap around the image. Maybe a new paragraph?</p>
            <p>And to show the wrap I will keep talking about how they are the cutest little critters on the planet. The Koala bear 
              may be the next adorable bear but that is another link. For now, you can enjoy the wonders of the Pander bear via the 
              following access button. Do enjoy!</p>

            <h3>A trip to tropical Mexico!</h3>
            <p>As much as I'm enjoying this education, I long for this view in a much nicer climate than here.
              Not enough sunshine this summer for me with working throughout. Soon enough though.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a trip to Mexico would satisfy my craving? I'll let you know my plans. LOL.</p>

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>Times are changing and our 35+ years of formal applications and processes 
            for self governance have been declined by the BC government. We are the only front-line health care providers 
            without our own health umbrella and automony. My education and experience is no longer a benefit as the BC College of 
            Dental Surgeons has decided that employees can be trained chairside. This completely devalues our certification 
            and opens incredible risk to the public. 
          </p>
          <p>Ask your next dental assistant if they're certified!</p>
