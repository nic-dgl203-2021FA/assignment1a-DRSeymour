            <h3>Assignment 1 with Christina Troung LinkedIn</h3>
            <p>This is a student project to review CSS coding. It is definately required.</p>
            <p>I know this will help me greatly as I was lost near the end of Introduction to CSS. Practice, 
              practice, practice! Besides, Panda bears are soooo cute! I wanted to continued talking about these cute little Bears so that I could 
              get the text to wrap around the image. Maybe a new paragraph?</p>
            <p>And to show the wrap I will keep talking about how they are the cutest little critters on the planet. The Koala bear 
              may be the next adorable bear but that is another link. For now, you can enjoy the wonders of the Pander bear via the 
              following access button. Do enjoy!</p>

            <h3>A trip to tropical Mexico!</h3>
            <p>As much as I'm enjoying this education, I long for this view in a much nicer climate than here.
              Not enough sunshine this summer for me with working throughout. Soon enough though.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a trip to Mexico would satisfy my craving? I'll let you know my plans. LOL.</p>
