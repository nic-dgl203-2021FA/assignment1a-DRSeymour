          <h2>Communications Design Student</h2>
            <p>I am seeking employment in my new career as a Graphics & Website Designer. With a few more months of 
              NIC education, I will be well on my way to showcasing my work!
            </p>
            <p>This is a career transition from Certified Dental Assisting of 35 years to finally express my creative
              side. I've always enjoyed dabbling in computer graphics and platform websites but now I will have more
              functionality of design. Twenty more years to put a mark in this world!
            </p>

            <h3>Social Good Poster</h3>
              <p>This is a student project to learn skills in Adobe Illustrator.
              </p>
              <p>This project was to research a graphic designer who inspired your and in their style, create a Poster
                to bring awareness to a social issue. The graphic designer I chose to imitate is Kate Moross because of her
                passion for candy wrapper packaging as a child. I too was inspired by the cartoonistic styling of many
                sweet treats!
              </p>
              <p>My social awareness issue is to 'Save the Bees'. It is a world wide issue in that it reflects our food 
                production everywhere as these pollinators travel far and wide. Modern pesticides and habitat destruction has 
                resulted in an alarming reduction of these important little critters. We need to change the destructive habits 
                and to accomplish this, media is necessary for awareness.

            <h3>Island Insider Magazine Cover</h3>
              <p>Part of the course was to design a fictional magazine cover. My concept was for a local magazine that included articles
                from all over Vancouver Island.  All expamples are completely imaginary with actual names and references. This cover was 
                designed with Adobe InDesign. 
              </p>
              <p>This project was to include useful islander information on wildlife, politics, local citizen exerts, and news of what's 
                happening in your neighbourhood. For more information on more of BC, please following this interesting magazine link.

              <p>These are some of my earlier drawings in FIN 110 Drawing & 2D Language.  </p>
              <p>These were purely for practice but our lesson was to exemplify different tone levels through different line marks 
                and mediums. We went on to do charcoal drawings to cast light or shadow in the appropriate areas.

           <h2>Work Experience</h2>
              <p>Times are changing and our 35+ years of formal applications and processes 
                for self governance have been declined by the BC government. We are the only front-line health care providers 
                without our own health umbrella and automony. My education and experience is no longer a benefit as the BC College of 
                Dental Surgeons has decided that employees can be trained chairside. This completely devalues our certification 
                and opens incredible risk to the public. 
              </p>
              <p><b>Ask your next dental assistant if they're certified!</b></p>
